Design/methodology/approach Based on survey data collected from six cities in India (n = 1,246), factor analysis and structural equation modeling are applied for data analysis and testing the study hypotheses. Findings The results of the structural equation model found UTAUT constructs performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and hedonic to positively affect behavioral intentions to adopt SPG.

Design/methodology/approach The domain of interest is a partially square porous enclosure with sinusoidal wall heating and cooling. The fluid flow, heat and mass transfer dimensionless governing equations associated with the corresponding boundary conditions are discretized using the finite volume method. The resulting algebraic equations are solved by an in-house FORTRAN code and the SIMPLE algorithm to handle the non-linear character of conservation equations. The validity of the in-house FORTRAN code is checked by comparing the current results with previously published experimental and numerical works. The effect of the porous layer thickness, the spatial frequency of heating and cooling, the Darcy number, the Rayleigh number and the porous to fluid thermal conductivity ratio is analyzed. Findings The results demonstrate that for high values of the spatial frequency of heating and cooling ( f = 7), temperature contours show periodic variations with positive and negative values providing higher temperature gradient near the thermally active wall. In this case, the temperature variation is mainly in the porous layer, while the temperature of the clear fluid region is practically the same as that imposed on the left vertical wall.

A numerical model is created to study the influence of heat-transfer designs and other factors on the thermal performance of the BTMS, and the simulation results are checked experimentally. The results show that when the condensation section of the heat pipe is cooled by liquid, the maximum temperature of the battery (Tmax) is reduced by 18.1% compared with air cooling. Decreasing the coolant temperature can reduce Tmax, but can also lead to an undesirable temperature nonuniformity. The Tmax and the maximum temperature difference (\u0394Tmax) in a battery module both increase rapidly as the discharge rate rises. The Tmax and \u0394Tmax are lower than 40 \u00b0C and 5 \u00b0C, respectively, when the discharge rate of the battery is lower than 2 \u00b0C.

Accurate and efficient prediction of the key features during these events has long been the focus of engine design processes. In this paper, a new body-force model that can capture the three-dimensional and unsteady features of stall and surge in compressors at a fraction of time required for URANS computations is proposed. To predict the rotating stall characteristics, the deviation of local airflow angle from the blade surface is calculated locally during the simulation. According to this local deviation, the computational domain is divided into stalled and forward flow regions, and the body-force field is updated accordingly; to predict the surge characteristics, the local airflow direction is used to divide the computational domain into reverse flow regions and forward flow regions.

Moreover, forecasting the electricity consumption for all the meters requires an enormous amount of time. Most papers tend to avoid such complexity by forecasting the electricity consumption at an aggregated level. This paper aims to forecast the electricity consumption for all smart meters at an individual level. This paper, for the first time, takes into account the computational time for training and forecasting the electricity consumption of all the meters. Design/methodology/approach A novel hybrid autoregressive-statistical equations idea model with the help of clustering and whale optimization algorithm (ARSEI-WOA) is proposed in this paper to forecast the electricity consumption of all the meters with best performance in terms of computational time and prediction accuracy. Findings The proposed model was tested using realistic Irish smart meters energy data and its performance was compared with nine regression methods including: autoregressive integrated moving average, partial least squares regression, conditional inference tree, M5 rule-based model, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, RandomForest, RPART and support vector regression. Results have proved that ARSEI-WOA is an efficient model that is able to achieve an accurate prediction with low computational time. Originality/value This paper presents a new hybrid ARSEI model to perform smart meters load forecasting at an individual level instead of an aggregated one. With the help of clustering technique, similar meters are grouped into a few clusters from which reduce the computational time of the training and forecasting process. In addition, WOA improves the prediction accuracy of each meter by finding an optimal factor between the average electricity consumption values of each cluster and the electricity consumption values for each one of its meters.", "cit_venues": [], "ref_venues": ["international journal of forecasting", "biometrika", "electric power systems research", "ieee trans smart grid", "electric power systems research", "ieee commun surv tut", "applied energy", "strat mgmt j", "korean j anesthesiol", "j intell inf syst", "advances in engineering software", "ijet", "journal of computational and applied mathematics", "energy procedia", "journal of the royal statistical society series b", "ieee trans smart grid", "renewable and sustainable energy reviews", null, "big data"], "pub_venue": "COMPEL - The international journal for computation and mathematics in electrical and electronic engineering"}, {"id": "10.1680/jener.21.00056", "title": "The UK industrial decarbonisation strategy revisited", "abstract": "Since 2010, successive UK governments have produced various strategies for industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (\u2018decarbonise\u2019).

These sources can reduce the thermal performance and increase the irreversibility of SPHEs. First, the critical factors of the heat loss rate to the environment, internal heat transfer rate (HTR), and channel temperature distributions are specified based on modeling the SPHE with hypothetical heat exchanger networks. Also, this modeling is validated with the results of channel temperature distributions by computational fluid dynamics simulation. Second, besides examining the spiral turns by entropy generation methods, entransy-based parameters are developed to analyze the SPHEs based on generated heat due to fluid viscosity in their channels for the first time. Finally, to show the method applicability proposed, an optimal designed single-phase counter-current SPHE is explored as a case. Three scenarios are introduced to evaluate the performance and irreversibility, namely heat leakage and no heat leakage to the environment and transferring the net heat between the streams. Results highlight the effects of non-adiabatic conditions, such as reductions of around 5.46%, 2.25%, and 2.42%, respectively, in the heat transfer area, total HTR, and overall heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, findings confirm the performance reductions and irreversibility increments in non-adiabatic conditions and assert the importance of covering the outermost channels appropriately.", "cit_venues": [], "ref_venues": ["math meth appl sci", "j therm anal calorim", "therm sci", "int j photoenergy", "int j photoenergy", "asme j heat transfer trans asme", "chem eng technol", "food bioprod process", "heat transfer eng", "process integr optim sustain", "cep", "int j heat mass transfer", "asme j heat transfer trans asme", "appl therm eng", "mas", "asme j heat transfer trans asme", "int j heat mass transfer", "asme j heat transfer trans asme", "asme j heat transfer trans asme", "energy", "ger", "adv powder technol", "therm sci", "cep", "int j heat mass transfer", "in chinese", "in chinese", "int j heat mass transfer", "int j heat mass transfer", "sci china technol sci", "int commun heat mass transfer", "int j heat mass transfer", "int j refrig", "heat transfer", null], "pub_venue": "Journal of Thermal Science and Engineering Applications"}, {"id": "10.1115/1.4053167", "title": "Sensitivity Analysis of the Levelized Cost of Electricity for a Particle-Based Concentrating Solar Power System", "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a sensitivity analysis of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for a particle-based system with the costs of the most current components.

The rest of component costs such as particle cost, cavity cost, and lift cost are set to lower and upper bounds estimating an uncertainty between 25% and 50%.

This study also includes an upgrade to the receiver model by including the wind effect in the efficiency, which was not included in previous publications and may have a big impact in the system design. A parametric analysis shows the optimum values of solar multiple, storage hours, tower height, and concentration ratio, and a probabilistic analysis provides a cumulative distribution function for a range of LCOE values.

Solar fuel is produced using a cavity reactor that captures concentrated solar radiation from a solar field of heliostats. In this paper, heat transfer model of a tubular plug-flow reactor designed and manufactured for a solar fuel production is presented. Experimental data collected from a fixed bed tubular reactor testing are used for model comparison. The system consists of an externally heated tube with counter-current flowing gas and moving solid particles as the heated media. The proposed model simulates the dynamic behavior of temperature profiles of the tube wall, gas, and particles under various gas flowrates and residence times. The heat transfer between gas\u2013wall, solid particle\u2013wall, and gas\u2013solid particle is numerically studied. The model results are compared with the results of experiments done using a 4 kW furnace with a 150 mm heating zone surrounding a horizontal alumina tube (reactor) with 50.8 mm outer diameter and thickness of 3.175 mm. Solid fixed particles of magnesium manganese oxide (MgMn2O4) with the size of 1 mm are packed within the length of 250 mm at the center of the tube length. Simulation results are assessed with respect to fixed bed experimental data for four different gas flowrates, namely, 5, 10, 15, and 20 standard liters per minute of air, and furnace temperatures in the range of 200\u20131200 \u00b0C. The simulation results showed good agreement with maximum steady state error that is less than 6% of those obtained from the experiments for all runs.
